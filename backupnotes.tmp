- Building a version with + button as memory backup.
- Have already commented that out, so assuming it works ready to make changes.

Pre changes:
INitial open loads renders homescreen followed by all categories. 
-- Actually it renders the first 10 twice.. i suspect its when the rest are loaded on screen? No biggie anyway.

Opening/closing category: just reerenders the category and notes/subcats inside 
Same with subcategory. Nothing else gets rerendered, just the one we clicked on + whats inside it.

Editting a note rerenders everything on screen. Blurring off the note just rerenders the note only.

OPening category modal rerenders everything on the screen. Presumably cos homescreen render? 
submitting the new category rerenders everything addBottomTileMargin

any menuoverlay rerenders everything (inc closing it)
any action such a make high priority or mark checked also rerenders everything on screen
move note rerenders everything 



General performance:
Tested in prob, all other apps closed. 

When all categories closed except one:

 Ticking note checkbox is clean, fast,  instantaneous.
 Opening closing categories is snappy
 Add new note snappy instantaneousn
 No discernible lag when editting notes
 Editting note in multiple locations appears instantenous 


 With all categories open:
 still scrolls adjustsFontSizeToFit
 checkboxes very noticeable take a bit longer to change when tapped (this may be easiest benchmark to see)
 closing categories still feels sharp but maybe not all registered as quickly 
 noticeable delay adding a new note
 noticeable lag editting notes that appear elsewhere
noticeable delay when opening menu overlay or modal

Its not huge but there is a small delay on most actions at the momeny when all categories are open.
